ideas for my personal website (EL version: ER doesn't need one lol)
- learn to type!

Home Page
- top nav bar
    - logo???? broadcast classic PFP?
    - headings (unless cards take care of everything)
    - don't need any style of login page unless want to:
        make login page the first page, all of this brainstorming past login

- main page: cards
    - links to where I keep all of my information
    - card style where "product pages" is detailed info abt what's where
    - LINK THE SITES LINK EVERYTHING 
    - topics
        - WP
        - Google Drive
        - A3
        - Notion
        - Stickies : does that have APIs
        - Phone Notes : how to app APIs work (or don't work)
        - My notebook????? (It's pretty but unefficient)
        - Spotify
        - Procreate
        - stats.fm
    - how to link to things that are not websites / on my computer (except notebook)

* unrelated, learn how to import playlists into xcel or sheets + keep it up to date 

- main page: image carosel
    - for funzies
    - photos that r on my photo frame? 
    - shitty meme content?
    - good EL related content?
